	<p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:130%"> Here is a collection of multimedia projects that I have created. Some feature original songs, original footage, and original artistic direction. Although I focus primarily on the sound of my music, the way that I am visually presented to the world online and in real life is also very important. Because of this, in addition to my music I also make my own promotional videos and vlogs so my fans feel that they know me more personally</p>

	<p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:130%">The official music video for my new song, "SLIPPERY". This song was produced in partnership with Chameleon Hex, my producer and boyfriend. Although his strengths are in the world of rock and roll, he is a very talented producer in addition to being a huge inspiration and collaborator of mine. The lyrics of the song are mostly about things that I like...real fur, hairless cats, my dogs, and extra sauce.</p>

	<p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:130%">This is a video I made using a song that was written and performed by the duo 18+. This video is representative of the style that I like both audibly and visually. Although not directly related to the world of PC Music, 18+'s music has the same experimental qualities that question and distort what pop music is. Effects on the video look kind of corny, but that's part of the appeal of PC Music. Taking something generic and impersonal that's created by a computer and reworking it until it resembles something close to art.</p>
