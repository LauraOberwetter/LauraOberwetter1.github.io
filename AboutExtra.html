			<strong><img src="http://exclaim.ca/images/AGCook2.jpg" alt="AG Cook" style="float:right;width:300px;height:230px;"><p style="color: black; text-align:right; font-size:150%">PC Music is a record label that defined an entirely new genre of music. Based in London, PC Music is run by AG Cook, a musician that releases his own music on the label. The genre typically features music with fast BPMs, sparkling electronic elements, and female singers with distorted up-pitched vocals. PC Music began in 2013, and began to gain attention in 2014 as Hannah Diamond and QT both released debut singles that gained critical attention on the album.</p></strong>
			<strong><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1MQUleX1PeA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="QT" style="float:left;width:350px;height:230px;"><p style="color: black; text-align:left; font-size:150%">PC Music was first seen in the USA in the spring of 2015. Featured at a showcase at SXSW, AG Cook, QT, and Sophie all made their US debuts. Later in the year, many musicians continued touring in the US as they were featured on many summer festival lineups.</p></strong>
			<strong><img src="http://attachment.pcmusic.info/img/Attachment-2-1000.jpg" alt="Hannah Diamond" style="float:right;width:200px;height:250px;"><p style="color: black; text-align:right; font-size:150%">For a music style that's so strange and so new, PC Music has seen considerable success in the past two years. Sophie's song "Lemonade" has been featured on a national McDonalds add and many other members of the PC Music collective have been featured on festival lineups and lists of critically acclaimed artists and albums. As the genre and label try to hold their own and prove that they are more than just a fad, PC Music has continuously been realising powerful and artistic music throughout 2016.</p></strong>

		<strong><p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:200%">ABOUT ME</p></strong>

			<strong><img src="file:///Users/Laura/Documents/Fall Semester 2016/ART 107/alterego/Images/IMG_0901.jpg" alt="me" style="float:left;width:300px;height:400px;"><p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:150%">I am a PC Musician and producer who blends pop, electronic, and experimental music. I was inspired by the 2015 outbreak of PC Musicians such as SOPHIE, QT, Danny L Harle, and AG Cook. I was also interested in how mainstream pop artists, such as Charli XCX and Carly Rae Jepsen, began participating in the world of PC Music by teaming up with PC Music producers</p></strong>
			<strong><p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:150%">I have produced and provided vocals to many PC Music hits such as "Sexy Digital Loincloth" and "Cyborg". my greatest inspiration is Carly Rae Jepsen. Although she isn't technically a part of the PC Music movement, she has collaborated with Danny L Harle on a track called "Supernatural"</p></strong>
			<strong><p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:150%">Although my real identity and personal information remains secret, as is true with most PC Musicians, it is common knowledge among my fans that I am a Caucasian female in my early 20's. In the world of PC Music, identities are very convoluted. Artists like SOPHIE perform under a name with feminine connotations and mix music with female vocals, yet are males. You would never know unless you saw SOPHIE perform live, which is rare, or you've done heavy research on the history of PC Music. Other male bodied and male oriented PC Musicians like AG Cook and Danny L Harle are the same, they are the authors of these songs, but they use up-pitched vocals from a woman in almost every track</p>
			<strong><p style="color: black; text-align:center; font-size:150%">This is one thing that make ExtraViolet different. While most men in the world of PC music only produce and rely on the vocals of females, most females in the PC Music world are the opposite. Women like GFOTY and QT both perform on stage and provide the lyrics and vocals to all of their songs, but these songs are usually produced by AG Cook, SOPHIE, or someone else. ExtraViolet is significant, impressive, and integral in the movement of this scene because as a woman, she has creative control and autonomy over every single step of the musical process.</p>
